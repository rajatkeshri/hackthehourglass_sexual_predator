Time’s almost out, and the five men in a binded Usv near me, both of us going at about 100 mph. I kick it up a notch, running at my maximum, 130mph. My top gear is bit under the normal a Divinew adlut’s average, and a lot below and the special’s. Then men start shooting me, but I manage to dodge. I am near the ship, but I fear it might of left. I push my legs harder, but that won’t help me, I will die, right here, right know. I turn to see a sword fly towards me, and it cuts threw my waist. I fall, and roll about 8 times. If it weren’t by my superhuman powers, I’d be dead. I rip the sword from my body, throw it at them, and run after the sword, the blade being a mere distraction, for I won’t go down without a good fight. As I near, pain spreads over me, then rage. I hold my waist, trying to keep my insides in my body. I spread towards them, in a rampage of kicks and fists. I am shot in the back by 3 shotguns at the same time, as I fall to my knees, struggling to breathe, I see a man come towards me. “You’re supposed to be on my side. You’d throw your friends, family, everything, just for this!!” I say tears threating to appear. A smirk forms on his evil face, and I meditate on how I didn’t realize how evil he was before. “Winning side, Tom. Don’t take it too personal,” he says. “   You traitor!” is the only thing I manage to murmur. “Pour oil on him” he says to 2 guards, and they do as instructed. “I’ll apologize in hell, old friend” he says, and I say “Can’t be there, I’ve kind ‘a  have and appointment in heaven”. He lights a cigar and smokes. “Fair enough, he says, an then a tosses the cigar on me. I immediately burn and I hope my family is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      " I wake up, it smells like pancakes. Boy, my mom does know how to start summer vacation. My room is dark, and I turn on my mark. It glows deep purple, and as always, I admire it. I quickly stand up, throw on some converse, jeans, and blue t-shirt, which, for a lazy ass like me, I kinda wired. But then again, being able to levitate, control, and read minds, running up to 90 mph, being able to beat anybody at school isn’t very normal. Then I wake up from my dream, remembering that I am, in this apocalyptic reality, a freak with superhuman powers.\n",

      "The city hung under a pall of grey, the roiling mass of cloud above and distant thunder promising a storm.  The streets were empty, with the exception of the few huddled figures going about their late-afternoon business.   From the hills to the east, the all-encompassing fog began to descend, making its way through the latticework of streets, tendrils of mist inquisitively groping at the forms of buildings and unlit street lamps.  The insistent wind pulls the fog towards the outskirts of the city, to a hill upon which a lone building stands, its stalwart and foreboding form the last bastion of civilization before the dark and untamed woods beyond.  From within this ancient, decrepit building can be heard the fevered sounds of the delirious, their unintelligible cacophonies echoing down the long, poorly lit halls.  At the end of one such hallway is a shadowed room, one of the numberless cells in this house of the insane.  Within, a frail figure lies in the corner of the room, curled upon the mold-infested floor.  The figure is that of an aged man, eyes bright with the intensity of madness, his long, unkempt beard and hair framing a face that had been hallowed by untold suffering.  Rocking back and forth in the darkness, the ancient man utters wordless litanies of hysteria, lost within his own twisted thoughts.  Each waking moment, every breath he takes brings unspeakable torment, for he is haunted by the self-created demons lurking in the lurid depths of his mind, a mind long without any vestiges of sanity.  He longs for the sweet release of sleep, but knows that he must suffer until the night, when he is administered his medication.  Until then, he waits, sequestered in the dark recesses of his mind, tortured by the misshapen, grotesquely howling denizens of his imagination.  Outside, rivulets of rainwater course languidly down the dirty glass of the window, framed by the sporadic flicker of lightning and shaken by the deep reverberations of thunder.  At last, its malevolent energy exhausted, the raging storm abates, and the clouds disperse, returning to their homes beyond the horizon, revealing the ivory crescent of the pure moon and the illimitable canvas of stars and distant galaxies beyond.  Within the asylum, a white-clad figure approaches the heavy door at the end of the hall, metal tray in hand.  Inside the cell, upon the moon-lit floor, the ancient man crawls towards the dark door.  With a rusty creaking, the door swings open, bathing the room in a dim glow.  The figure in white sets down the tray and eases the heavy door shut, securing the bolt on the other side.  Upon the tray rests a small porcelain cup, filled with a garish amber substance.  Trembling, the old man reaches for the crucible and the medicine within, the glowing golden elixir which would set him free.  Downing the mixture, the aged man coughs and hacks, almost choking, before catching his breath.  Ecstatic, the man begins to feel the effects of the elixir, the numbing, blissfully painless tranquility coursing throughout his body.  At last, he slips into unconsciousness, the silence of deep slumber enveloping him and his tortured visions utterly.\n",

      "He wandered alone in the vast expanse of his mind, of the demons there was no sign.  He began his journey across the black wastelands of his dream, crossing through the horrendous valley of despair, luckily uninhabited by the demons of his waking nightmares, and at last arriving at the rolling plains of memory.  The crescent moon hangs over the foothills, basking the plains in a surreal glow.  The familiar sight of a small, homely cottage greeted the man as he strode across the silent fields of his ancient memories.  Opening the stained wooden door, he stepped inside.    The cottage was one-roomed, just as he had remembered it from his childhood long ago.  In the center was a small table, and two hand-carved wooden chairs neatly tucked under it.  He ignored the undisturbed furniture and turned to the far wall of the room.  Dominating this wall was large, intricately gilded mirror, fantastic images of long-forgotten tales and magnificent vistas adorning its golden frame.  Gazing into the shifting surface of the mirror, the old man beheld his ragged and time-worn body.  Touching the surface of the mirror, he felt energy begin to pour into him, racing from his fingertips into his arm and into his body.  Light poured forth from his aged form, and he felt his frail form being unmade.  At last, the transformation was complete, and he saw in the mirror opposite a figure, not the old and weakened man, but a remnant of past times, a healthy, vibrant young man, untouched by madness and the inexorable passage of time.  Smiling, he stepped outside, and regarded the night sky above him, stars dancing in ever-shifting patterns around the pale moon.  Closing his eyes, he began to rise into the air, currents of dream-wind carrying him upwards, towards the constellations.  He flew past the moon, past the winking lights of the dancing stars, until at last behind him, the dark hemisphere of his dream-world had disappeared completely.  Finally he broke through the obscuring mist of space and out into the night above the city, wings of crystalline filaments carrying him onwards.  He whirled above the sleeping city, letting himself be tossed about by the dream-energy of the thousands slumbering beneath him.  Reaching into his pocket, he drew forth a silver compass.  Eyeing the needle, he dived towards the city, racing past the rows of street lamps lining the empty streets.  At last he saw his destination, a small, shining golden dream-cloud suspended outside the window of a small apartment.  Upon the front of the cloud was a nondescript wooden door, and he reached for the silver knob.  The door was locked, and the man reached into his pocket and produced a magnificent silver key.  Sliding the key into the worn lock, he felt the tumblers fall away one by one.  The door opened before him, and he stepped through.  He found himself in a dark wood, the rotting trees interlaced with a creeping mist.  The air was stagnant, and the smell of sulphur was almost nauseating.  Suddenly, in the distance, a shrill scream pierced the stillness of the night.  He ran towards the sound, racing past fallen trees and decaying fauna.  He at last reached the source of the cry, a young boy cowering in a clearing.  He moved to console the distraught child, but from the woods leapt a massive beast, covered in long oily fur, its glowing, coal-like eyes burning in the darkness of the foreboding forest.  It strode forward, its maw glowing with row upon row of brilliantly sharp fangs, its massive paws adorned with wicked claws.  .  The beast faced the man, breath steaming with boundless hunger.  With a thought, the man created about himself a suit of golden armour, blindingly radiant in contrast to the sublime blackness of the beast.  Reaching once again into his pocket, the man withdrew his shining Vorpal blade, which grew into a great longsword, and turned to face the beast.  Its claws raked out in a wide arc, nearly catching the man, but he turned the blade up to block the great paws.  Vibrant sparks flew as the nightmarish claws of the monster clashed with the blade forged in the fires of pure imagination, both combatants expertly blocking and swiftly lashing out at the other, hoping to find an opening in the other’s defence.  At last the man saw his opportunity, and with a mighty thrust took the beast through the heart.  Roaring in agony, the great beast burst into flames, acrid smoke pouring forth from its eyes and mouth.  Soon, nothing was left of it except for a pile of smouldering ash and the fading echoes of its death throes.  Turning to the young boy, who gazed in amazement at this shining paladin, the man removed his crested golden helm and presented it to the child.  The boy eagerly accepted, and then ran off into the woods, now lush with greenery and lit by the warm glow of an evening sun.  The man felt the dream unravelling about him and cut himself loose from the strand tying him to the vision of the child, and found himself once more floating above t\n",
